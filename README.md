# Pathfinding in Grid-Based Environments using JavaScript and React

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement pathfinding in a grid-based environment using JavaScript and React. By combining the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm with React components, we can create interactive applications for solving pathfinding problems.

## Overview

Pathfinding algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or grid. In this tutorial, we'll focus on implementing pathfinding specifically in a grid-based environment. We'll use a two-dimensional array, often referred to as a matrix, to represent the grid.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm used for exploring nodes in a graph or grid. It starts at a given node (or cell in our case) and explores all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors. This property makes BFS particularly suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs or grids.

## Implementation

We'll implement the BFS algorithm in JavaScript, specifically tailored for grid-based pathfinding. Additionally, we'll use React to create an interactive user interface for visualizing the grid and pathfinding process.

### PathFinder Class

The `PathFinder` class represents our pathfinding algorithm. It contains methods for initializing the grid, performing BFS, and checking the validity of the path.

### React Components

We'll create React components to visualize the grid and interact with the pathfinding algorithm. These components will display the grid, allow the user to initiate the pathfinding process, and visualize the path once found.

## Cloning the Repository

To get started with the project, you can clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utku-guclu/path-finder.git
```

## Running the Application

Navigate into the cloned repository directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd path-finder
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application with the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser, and you can interact with the pathfinding visualization.

## Conclusion

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement pathfinding in a grid-based environment using JavaScript and React. You can further extend this project by experimenting with different pathfinding algorithms, adding obstacles or additional features to the grid interface, and exploring more complex grid layouts.

Happy coding!
